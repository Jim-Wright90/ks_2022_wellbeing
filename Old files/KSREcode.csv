It seems like the community is beginning to find it ªs voice and saying what it believes and how it wants it to be. For example, in tourism people used to come for a fictitious paradise. The community is saying what they want to share, and folks are wanting to come to see what Hawai ªi is about, what the community has to offer. The key thing is our resources and treasures, a lot of us have not gone away and when you grow up with our island resources and treasures and we don ªt see them as resources. Our natural resources, such as Maunakea, oceanography, our culture, our people, our holistic agriculture. In one of our programs, we do natural farming, growing taro in Kona for example. The collective view and holistic process and we are valuing this type of knowledge and information and others come here and are looking for this kind of knowledge rather than the sun, surf, sea. They want to walk in our forests, walk along our shores and learn this. Being able to share this connectedness is the strength of our community. In comparison to Oahu and Maui we have dryland forest in Puna and have space to learn from different ethnic groups and live with nature and grow gardens and have a simple life.","We can ªt go back to the old, but we do need to move ahead and one of the big issues on Hawai ªi island is broadband internet. We have so many areas that aren ªt serviced by broadband/internet/cell phone service and this is the way we connect to the world. That is one issue.  Another issue we are facing is a leadership issue. As we change from being a Western-less brain and less big company to the power of the people and community we ªre at a loss for leadership even from the presidential community all the way down. We don ªt have strong leadership to move people to build community. We need to grow people because it ªs a new way. We need to develop more people that are able to take these leadership roles and develop our community. Meaning the people that live and work here, need to fill these roles. Even in our political races, we only have two people to vote for in our community and there isn ªt that strong leadership.

The jobs they create and the people that live there, they are taking care of the beach park and the camping and they can charge the campers. This has created jobs to hire people to do the parking lot and run a store. They are trying to get funding to rebuild some of the akule fishing boats and offer tours and teach the younger generation how to do these boats, feeding the fish in the old style by picking ulu. Sharing this knowledge and passing it on, we fund. We also fund projects in Waipio valley and they take care of the pathways and support the children working the lo ªi there. Funded groups in Puna for lauhala weaving, cooking in the imu, different things, learning hula for the community members. Working together with the community to provide things for the children. The Jacob museum when it was destroyed another museum opened in Puna and is housing those things.

Our president Aunty Dotty is a driving force for the betterment of our community and we are lucky to have her. She helped to rally our community recently when the city and county tried to have a half way house without community input and in minutes let the community know what was happening and what the next steps were.  Our second strength is most of our community is generational ohana that are related to each other and we know the majority of other families that move in here. We care for each others homes when going away on trips or keeping an eye out for people who don't look trustworthy.","The two most important issues facing our community are locals, especially Hawaiians can not afford to keep living here. Costs keep going up for us and for many of us pay and hours were cut due to COVID for the past 7 months and people from outside of Hawaii have continued to buy out homes above the asking price from us locals. It is getting harder to buy everything we need.  The second issue is drugs. We have a drug problem which leads to homeless community members and members who are looking for easy things to steal. Down my street alone the week of Thanksgiving our community association mini bus had the converter was stolen, 2 separate neighbors mopeds, and quite a few children's bikes. These people are rarely taken into custody and if it is it's for a short time and released and nothing was changed and they certainly haven't done anything to change their behavior for the future.","1","5","5","5","5","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","2","2","2","We are a strong people.

The systems currently put in place help corporations over people. Na Pua Makani under the guise of clean energy was allowed to not need community input to put up windmills in Kahuku right next to 2 schools, a hospital and a bird sanctuary.  Monsanto was allowed to spray pesticides without care for our people and land even though what they were spraying was deemed unsafe.

Kaiapuni kumu make their own curriculum, worksheets, books and are not paid for their extra time and work. Kaiapuni schools that are lumped in with English schools such as Kahuku and Hauula are not given the equal access to programs because one they simply do not exist (IXL) or the cost is so much more for Hawaiian made products (school planners) and support as the English side. It has been my experience that we (a parent of Kaiapuni children) have had to ""fight"" for equal treatment and often do not have the full support of administrators who truly want us to succeed and look for ways to work with us to make that happen. I work hard every year to look for grants for our teachers to not have to spend so much of their own money on supplies.","Strengthening Native Hawaiian communities is a <strong>personal</strong> goal.","I volunteer at our local kaiapuni schools for events and field trips. I volunteered for the past 5 years to secure educational grants for our kaiapuni teachers at Kahuku and Hauula. I help in our community and school mala.

There is so much information floating around that people either consume incorrect information or misinterpret information or base their decisions and opinions on reading a biased headline versus doing the due diligence to be fully educated on a topic before taking a stance.

Our complete rejection of this project could run the risk of future projects declining to come to Hawaii for fear of being pushed out or Hawaiians being viewed as too difficult to work with. We need to find a way to move forward and ensure Hawaiians have a respected seat and voice at the table at the inception of these types of projects.","Strengthening Native Hawaiian communities is both a <strong>personal and professional</strong> goal.","A misperception by many is that to strengthen the Native Hawaiian community, you must only focus on and do Hawaiian things. For example, you must study Hawaiian Studies in college, you must become a Kumu and teach 'Olelo or Hawaiian history and culture, you must practice Native Law, etc. The reality is that not all Native Hawaiians fall into these categories and that's ok. Because at the end of the day, if my path has taken me to a more ""mainstream or conventional"" professional or personal journey, but I excel at what I'm doing and I'm pono in what I'm doing. If I am industry or community leader who is also Native Hawaiian and who proudly shares that I'm Native Hawaiian, shedding positive light on being Native Hawaiian, then I deserve to be respected as a person who is ultimately contributing to the strengthening and betterment of the Native Hawaiian community. We need successful, intelligent, caring and conscious Native Hawaiians in all industries, in all professions, in all hobbies, sports and in all corners of the world showing the world our incredible talent, skills and most of all our Aloha.
