Second important issue: Traffic safety—most specifically pedestrian safety.  Itʻs time to truly address scofflaws, whether they are the pedestrians or the drivers. With bikes and mopeds and scooters traveling on sidewalks in Waikīkī, or along the Ala Wai Canal, pedestrians are constantly at risk for harm.
